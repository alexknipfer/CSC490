**Note**
Only handles n <= 20, didn't have time for extra credit > 20

Bugs:
- There were a couple of times some of the coordinates printed a long
negative number (believe it's fixed though)

Summary:
I began with the even numbers because they were simple (obviously). The amount of
squares will always be 4 of size n / 2. I then created vectors that keep track of the
coordinates for the squares then print.
