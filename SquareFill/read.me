Bugs:
- Doesn't find correct values for odd numbers
- Doesn't print coordinates for odd numbers

Summary:
I began with the even numbers because they were simple (obviously). The amount of
squares will always be 4 of size n / 2. I then created vectors that keep track of the
coordinates for the squares then print.
